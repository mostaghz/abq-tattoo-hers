# to-do list #

### body ###
- add fonts
- change black background color to darker gray so it's not too intense??

### header ###
- drop down nav bar that links to specific artist
    - OR sticky button that takes users back to top
- add better background image

### artist directory ###
- ~~resize photos (and possibly reshape into circles)~~
- change link/icon colors (hover too?)
- figure out formatting for ul/li specialties (also how to avoid bullet points showing up for artist who don't have that many specialties)
- add instagram icon/links
- figure out how to get links to open on new tab instead of totally redirecting
- center p tags after breaking for mobile view

### footer icons ###
- replace? githib negative space is actually unclickable negative space
- change colors (hover too?) to match artist directory links
