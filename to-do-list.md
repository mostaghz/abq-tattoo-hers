# to-do list

### body
~~- add fonts~~

### header?
~~- drop down nav bar that links to specific artist?~~
  ~~- make sticky top~~ 
  ~~- dropdown menu gives horizontal scroll...~~
  - make transparent-ish when scrolling
  - fix:
    - bar color
    - dropdown menus background color
    - text/hover text colors
    - hamburger icon color?
    ~~- need to move artist drop down to right side... justify-text-end, text-end, ml-auto havent' worked~~
~~- add better background image? video?~~


### artist directory
~~- ~~resize photos (and possibly reshape into circles)~~~~
~~- change link/icon colors (hover too?)~~
~~- figure out formatting for ul/li specialties (also how to avoid bullet points showing up for artist who don't have that many specialties)... pretty sure need an if statement (if specialtiesX === '' || undefined) or something~~
~~- add instagram links~~
~~- add hyperlinked icons instead of section titles?~~
~~- figure out how to get links to open on new tab instead of redirecting~~
~~- center p tags after breaking for mobile view~~
~~- add space between image and h1 when vertically stacking in mobile~~
~~- write new code (for each?) to spit out specialties array~~
  ~~- reduce code (initially for bullet points) seems to be causing horizontal scroll... maybe for each will help...~~
~~- figure out how to get two cards on same line... NOTHING HAS WORKED SO FAR~~
~~- resize images (300x300) and add to images/artists directory~~
~~- add gutter or gaps between cards in desktop~~
- check break points -- looks weird between desktop and mobile--- work with media query?
- decrease margin between cards in mobile
~~- fix spaces between text lines AND make text flush with top of image~~

### footer icons
~~- replace? githib negative space is actually unclickable negative space~~
~~- change colors (hover too?) to match artist directory links~~

### general
- clean up code
  - add comments
  - no wetness... lol (dry)
