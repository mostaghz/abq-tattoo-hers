# to-do list

### body
- add fonts
- change black background color to darker gray so it's not too intense??

### header?
- drop down nav bar that links to specific artist?
  - need to move artist drop down to right side... justify-text-end, text-end, ml-auto havent' worked
- sticky button that takes users back to top
- add better background image?


### artist directory
~~- ~~resize photos (and possibly reshape into circles)~~~~
~~- change link/icon colors (hover too?)~~
~~- figure out formatting for ul/li specialties (also how to avoid bullet points showing up for artist who don't have that many specialties)... pretty sure need an if statement (if specialtiesX === '' || undefined) or something~~
~~- add instagram links~~
~~- add hyperlinked icons instead of section titles?~~
~~- figure out how to get links to open on new tab instead of redirecting~~
~~- center p tags after breaking for mobile view~~
~~- add space between image and h1 when vertically stacking in mobile~~
~~- write new code (for each?) to spit out specialties array~~
  ~~- reduce code (initially for bullet points) seems to be causing horiozontal scroll... maybe for each will help...~~

### footer icons
- replace? githib negative space is actually unclickable negative space
~~- change colors (hover too?) to match artist directory links~~
