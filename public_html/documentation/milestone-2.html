    <!-- TITLE AND TAG LINE -->
    <h3>Name and Tag Line:</h3>
        <p>The site name (Abq Tattoo*hers) will be in large font with a tag line in the same/smaller font describing its purpose. These two lines of text will be overlaid on a large background image of a female tattoo artist tattooing someone.</p>

    <!-- TATTOO ARTIST DIRECTORY -->
    <h3>Tattoo Artist Directory:</h3>
        <p>This is a directory, so we're jumping right into the content (there will be up to 14 artist sections. Each section will have the same information and layout, and will be organized by first name (no last names will be listed). Their name will be in the same font as the title/tag line while the other content will be in a different font and a smaller size. Applicable items in the content will be hyperlinked.</p>
        <p>Wishlist:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Desktop view: artist name will change color (to match title/tag line) when hovered over</li>
        </ul>
