    <!-- CONTENT STRATEGY -->
    <h2>Content Strategy</h2>
    <p><em>Please note wishlist items aren't included in the wireframes.</em></p>

    <!-- TITLE AND TAG LINE -->
    <h3>Name and Tag Line (Top of Page):</h3>
        <p>The site name (Abq Tattoo*hers) will be in large font with a tag line in the same/smaller font describing its purpose. These two lines of text will be overlaid on a large background image of a female tattoo artist tattooing someone.</p>
        <p>Wishlist:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Video (no sound) in lieu of image</li>
            <li>Site name and tag line change color when hovered over and return to normal when mouse is away</li>
            <li>A sticky dropdown nav bar at the top of the page (above the image/video) that links to each artist section further down the page</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- TATTOO ARTIST DIRECTORY -->
    <h3>Tattoo Artist Directory (Middle of Page):</h3>
        <p>This is a directory, so we're jumping right into the content. There will be up to 14 artist sections. Each section will have the same information and layout (F pattern), and will be organized by first name (people typically know an artist by first name or Instagram handle). Artist names will be in the same font as the title/tag line while the other content will be in a different font and a smaller size. Applicable items in the content will be hyperlinked.</p>
        <p>Wishlist:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Desktop view: artist name will change color (to match title/tag line) when hovered over and return to normal when mouse is away</li>
            <li>Mobile view: the artist photo will stack on top of its corresponding text</li>
            <li>If no nav bar as mentioned above, a sticky button to the right or left of the page that sends users back to the top of the page</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- CONTACT LINKS FOOTER -->
    <h3>Footer with Contact Links (Bottom of Page):</h3>
        <p>The footer will credit me as the site's designer and builder, as well as provide clickable icons linked to my email address, GitHub, and LinkedIn.</p>

    <!-- WIREFRAMES -->
    <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p><em>Please note there will be more than four artists in the directory. I didn't want to copy and paste the same content/layout up to 14 times.</em></p>
