        <!-- PURPOSE -->
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>Abq Tattoo*hers will be an easy resource for those looking to get tattooed by female tattoo artists in Albuquerque, NM. It will include the following info for each artist:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Artist first name</li>
                <li>Shop name (site hyperlinked)</li>
                <li>Artist Instagram</li>
                <li>Artist specialities (black and grey, color, american traditional, fine line, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Tattooing, like software development is a male-dominated industry. As a female developer, it's important to support and surround myself with people like me. It's imperative that I also promote and work with female tattoo artists.</p>
            <p>When I started my tattoo journey, I spent hours:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Googling shops</li>
                <li>looking at their artists</li>
                <li>finding a female artist (some shops are all male)</li>
                <li>combing through her portfolio determining if our styles aligned</li>
                <li>starting this process over for each artist and different shop</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Tattoo artist research is fun but tedious. Abq Tattoo*hers aims to streamline this process. Outside of chaotic reddit and Yelp reviews that aren't maintained or updated, this resource doesn't exist.<p>
            <p>Abq Tattoo*hers also has serious potential and can grow (after my bootcamp experience) to eventually include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>artists from all over NM, the USA, and even the world</li>
                <li>shops that are LGBTQIA+ friendly</li>
                <li>notifications about artists' relocations</li>
                <li>a regular newsletter with artist interviews and other info/goodies</li>
                <li>an interactive map for easy location services</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>Abq Tattoo*hers main audience is Albuquerque women (and likely LGBTQIA+ people) wanting to get tattooed by a female tattoo artist. This site can also be a resource for the NM Tattoo Fiesta (an annual tattoo convention in Albuquerque) to help promote female artists.</p>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>Website:</p>
        <p>I want to promote female tattoo artists and make the tattoo artist search easier for people. I also want Abq Tattoo*hers to actually be useful and not exist solely as a bootcamp project.</p>
        <p>Personal:</p>
        <p>I want to showcase my developer skills to potential employers</p>
