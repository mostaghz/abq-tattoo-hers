    <h1>ABQ Tattoo*hers: PWP Milestone 1</h1>

   <!-- PURPOSE, AUDIENCE, AND GOALS -->
    <h2>Purpose, Audience, and Goal</h2>

    <!-- PURPOSE -->
    <h3>Purpose:</h3>
        <p>ABQ Tattoo*hers will be a directory of female tattoo artists in Albuquerque, NM that will streamline the fun, yet sometimes tedious, task of researching different artists and their styles.
        <p id="sideNote"><em>Tattooing, like software development is a male-dominated industry. As a female developer, it's important to support and surround myself with people like me. It's imperative that I also promote and work with female tattoo artists.</em></p>

        <!-- AUDIENCE -->
    <h3>Audience:</h3>
        <p>ABQ Tattoo*hers main audience is Albuquerque women (and likely LGBTQIA+ people) wanting to get tattooed by a female artist. This site can also be used as exposure for apprentices or new-to-the-505 artists, and can even serve as a resource for the NM Tattoo Fiesta (an annual tattoo convention in Albuquerque) to help promote female artists.</p>

        <!-- GOAL -->
    <h3>Goal:</h3>
        <p>The primary goal of ABQ Tattoo*hers is to streamline the tattoo research process for those wanting to get some ink, and to promote Albuquerque's female tattoo artists -- I want this to be a legitimate resource that people actually use. The secondary goal is to proudly include this in my portfolio and showcase my developer skills to potential employers. </p>
